### Project Overview
A deep dive into how Cybernoid works, by studying its original Z80 machine code.

This project is a full disassembly of the ZX Spectrum version of Cybernoid.
I'm working to reverse-engineer the game, adding labels, comments, and notes to make the code easier to understand. Itâ€™s a big job, starting from address only assembly instructions.

I'm referencing the original disassembly by Derek Bolli [^1footnote]
, who did a fantastic job extracting the raw code. However, it's a plain instruction dump without labels, so all jumps are hardcoded to memory locations. My aim is to build on this and make it easier to follow.
